In the age of free infrmation, plenty of resources, no limit knowledge, open courses from top universities ... why are you not a recognized mathmatician hum ?
Explain yourself why are your not absorbing knowledge as it was sweet beverage ?

learning is hard. In the information era, how to explain that knowledge is not following the trend. Countries with educational system once considered like gold standard became poor performers on international ranking. Politics, economics, demographics, are all great explanators. Read this article carefully and ask yourself how your school education implemented this.

before presenting the methods. let me tell you from experience what are the commonly accepted wisdoms that are uttelry false.

1. debate between teacher vs autodidact

Ultimately everything you learn is by your own. whether you have a teacher, a book or you follow a youtube channel, the reality is that the biggest learning is made by yourself. As much as you think that a good teacher is important, in our era of free and accessible information, the importance of relying of a single truth of source to learn something, is not just overestimated, it can be detrimental. Even today, in some countries, having access to a professor is a luxury, because information is rare, and hard to access. If you are not in these countries, a professor could be at best a good motivator and being forced to be physically present somewhere instead of doing silly things is beneficial to youngsters that may not be equiped to spend quality time elwhere in a healthy environment outside of school. But if we talk about strictly about information processing, learning, and engaging actively with the concepts you hear from your teacher or the blackboard, unfortunately the role of the professor falls short.
Good professors may be outlining a comprehensive and progressive sequence of conetpts, ma,naging deadline and "forcing" you to learn some concepts that build on previous ones undera certain times with deadlines and exams, test your knowledge and answer your questions.
Professors wont teach you, you are your own teacher. professors offer a path to self and safe discovery that may or may not align with your interests but help to cope with lack of self discipline as you are "forced" to get a specific knowledge under a specific time contraint.


2. Learning is less about intelligence and more about methodology, discipline and comittment
IQ is a controversed measure. It is a statiscal artefact that help scientists explain and predict academic performance, professional success. It is a good measure as it captures information hardly accessible to explain differences between indididuals. Nonetheless, it does not mean that because it can be useful when reasearchers do study at the population scale, that it is relevant to predict your own success. And if you wen through highschool without cognitive limitations, it is safe to tell you to ignore studies or statistics. IQ can explain difference between two people putting the work and the discipline. Without discipline, natural intelligence fells shorter and faster than you can imagine.
we thrive for human stories beyond the possible, and look up to those special gifted people. We all know quotes supposedly from einstein or even his IQ, correct or not, but how many people know about how he oragnized his day to day life about work, his learning methodology, his discipline and weekly hours devoted to his research. It is less exciting to dig into this kind of details as it will get the legend more about work and less abot super powers. And that is what we miss : in a world full of distraction and instant gratification, being disciplined and comitted is a super power.


3. reasoning is about pattern recognition. learning is about building a pattern library.

I am quite a stubborn individual and because I like being intellectually challenged, when I start learning a new concept or doing something new for the first time, i tend to come up alone with a solution "relying on my own intelligence". This is a common mistake that took me years to realize as it dramatically slow down the speed and depth of the skills i am learning. I am so afraid to cheat myself when looking at the solution or asking for help too early. It is a fair concern is help is asked too early for a fairly simple challenge. It is because the curse of being a noob : ignoring what we dont know.  It is hard to gauge the relative difficulty of a new task.
A common scenario: new concept.
Dave tries to do an exercice that realies directly on the concept A and the concept B. Dave does not even know that the exercice requires to know a and b, even yhough it knows B.



Let us go super concrete :
Dave tries to teach himself programming to get a professional level and get a job. What follows may not be exactly true if dave was doing programming as a hobby without the specific goal of being competitive on the job market.


|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| How hard you tried		    | Very hard			   | Very hard                           |
| How long you tried                | 30 min max                   | More                                |
| Theory       			    | just in time when blocked    | before attempting exercice  	 |



Pros and cons

| cognitive load		    | Lower 		 | Higher			       |
| Feeling of cheating yourself      | Higher             | Lower                               |
| How fast you move                 | Faster             | Slower with risk of demotivation    |
| Feeling of reward 	    	    | Lower              | Higher                              |
| How far can you go                | Far                | Not far                             |
| Perceived efficiency              | Shallow learning   | deeper learning                     |
| True efficiency                   | more efficient	 | less efficient                      |
| Risk of losing discipline	    | lower		 | higher			       |





Then i am learning programming, doing and exercise or a project,





many people walking in the same direction acrooss the trees, bushes and vegetation for a few days, and as time passes, to maintain this new path, you would need less and less people, walking less and less frequently and it will still be there. eventually, in a long time, if one person walks over it and the next one walking appears too late, the nature will take the control back and the trace of the path will disappear .
creating  the information of information is hard,  storing it requires closed repetitions, maienting store and retriving it is cheaper and cheaper with time. Spaced repetition is the way of taking advantage of biology.

concretely : use fibonaccy sequence to know when to repeat what you learn : test your memory on day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, the other days, learn something else or rest.

## 2. Active Recall üéØ

> *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just reread, test yourself.‚Äù*

Active recall means trying to remember the material **without looking at the notes**.  
It forces your brain to retrieve information, which strengthens memory pathways.

Example:
```text
