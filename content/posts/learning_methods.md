# Effective Learning Methods

Learning is not just about consuming information ‚Äî it's about structuring knowledge in a way that makes it usable, memorable, and applicable. In this post, I‚Äôll share some practical methods to improve how you learn.

## 1. Spaced Repetition ‚è≥

Instead of cramming everything in one sitting, spread out your reviews over time. This leverages the **spacing effect**, helping you remember information for longer.

- Use tools like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) or flashcards.  
- Review at increasing intervals: 1 day ‚Üí 3 days ‚Üí 7 days ‚Üí 14 days.

It forces your brain to retrieve information, which strengthens memory pathways.
